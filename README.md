# Responsive Blog
This is a Udacity FSND learning project.

It's a single web-page looking like a blog, that is built with HTML and CSS. It's fully responsive, looking pretty at different screen sizes, having different versions of images to be loaded depending on the screen size.

To run the project simply clone the repository and open index.html with a web-browser of your choice.
